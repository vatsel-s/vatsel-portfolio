            Built ReLease, an interactive web application that allows landlords and tenants to easily manage leases and rental agreements. The app features AI summaries for long, convoluted 
            lease documents, making it easier for users to understand their rights and responsibilities. It also includes an AI agent, powered by Letta and Gemini, that allows tenants and 
            landlords to change their lease terms through natural language conversations, with real time updates for both parties.
